                <p class="uk-heading-small uk-text-center uk-text-capitalize">Welcome to my website!</p>
                
                <p>My apologies in advance, I'm not the best at web development. I'm Noah, an IT professional in the financial services industry.</p>

                <h2 class="uk-heading-divider">A Little About Me</h2>

                <p>
                  I'm <span id="age"></span> years old. Born and raised in Kingston, Ontario (🇨🇦 Canada 'eh) I attended Carleton University in Ottawa where I studied computer networking and picked up a ton of useful information from it (the kind that I have actually been able to apply) which is what jumpstarted my career into IT.
                  I moved back to Kingston and got my first job out of school at one of those "figure out how to do everything" startup companies which was stressful and for which I was neglectfully underpaid. It did allow me to expand my skill set by quite a bit for the few years I was there,
                  so I am thankful for that. Took a new job as a Linux administrator for an insurance company (I am somehow now their resident Kubernetes expert) where I continue to work today (remotely). And as of 2022, I've moved back in with my parents in Kitchener-Waterloo so that I can pay down my student loans and pull
                  together a down payment for a house (hopefully in this lifetime).
                </p>  
                
                <p>
                  I'm pretty good at cooking. I enjoy some casual gaming on the weekends (Factorio is my favorite). I spend a lot of time fiddling around with my homelab, and I enjoy hanging out with my dog Ruby. Trust me, I'm not that exciting. What I am, however, is immensely inquisitive. I love to learn new things and apply
                  that knowledge where I can. Generally, if there is something I need to know or a skill I need to learn, I'll do whatever I need to learn it.
                </p>

                <h2 class="uk-heading-divider">My Relationship With Technology</h2>
                
                <p>
                  One of my biggest focuses in life since I was little has been technology. From phones to computers, hardware to software, 3D printing to embedded electronics, I love all of it. One of my defining qualities is my curiosity, and my ability to rapidly learn new things and adapt that knowledge.
                  I am never quite satisfied with what I know and I'm always trying to find something new to learn about. I feel as though a lot of people fancy themselves a "Jack of all trades" sort of person, I am certainly no exception, but with the wide variety of projects I've worked on (both professionally and personally)
                  I'd like to think that is a claim that I can back up.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One thing that I've noticed over the years, be it with friends in the IT industry or co-workers, is that work will often make you good at a small handful of specific tasks or applications, but in my personal opinion that rarely makes someone a truly masterful IT professional. For someone to really
                  bring their skills to the next level, it is an absolute requirement that you have a true passion for IT. You should go out of your way to try new things in your free time because you want to, not because you have to. For myself, there is no better way to do this than with my homelab
                  (<a class="uk-link-heading" href="#" uk-switcher-item="1"><u>you should really check it out</u></a>). Kubernetes, Active Directory, networking, I do a little bit (or sometimes a lot) of everything in my homelab. It's even where I run this website!
                </p>

                <p>
                  I find that I like to bounce between things a lot. I'll get really into something for a few months, set it up in my homelab, and then promptly forget about it until something breaks. HomeAssistant was like that for me, I set everything up <i>juuust</i> right, and then promptly forgot about it until
                  something would inevitably break. When I started working for Empire Life in 2021, I had exactly zero experience with Kubernetes. I mean, I had heard of it and I knew what it was for, but I had never actually used it. Fast forward to today and it continues to be one of my most-used tools. Every day at work 
                  I am working in Kubernetes in some capacity or another, and at home, Kubernetes is the primary driver for my homelab (this website even runs in it). I think the difference with Kubernetes is that there really isn't any end to the number of useful things you can learn about it. It's an infinitely
                  expandable platform (both in terms of scalability and functionality you can add to it) and that is something that I continue to love about it. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="uk-heading-divider">Some Hobbies and Passions</h2>

                <p>
                  If you've read this far it should go without saying that first and foremost Homelabbing is one of my favorite things to do. I hoard a lot of data in my lab too, my TV and movie library is unreal.
                </p>

                <p>
                  3D printing is pretty neat. It taught me the basics of CAD and has come in handy a few times when I've needed small plastic parts that I would never be able to find in a store or online. It's also fun to print up some more decorative pieces to add a little bit of flair
                  to a room. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  I'm pretty good a cooking, I can make some pretty amazing casseroles and I've got this creamy chicken recipe that I just can't get enough of. During the summer I get into smoking meats, nothing beats fresh smoked fall-off-the-bone ribs!
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of my stranger hobbies is budgeting. I religiously track my income and spending habits (shoutout to <a class="uk-link-heading" target=”_blank” href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/"><u>YNAB</u></a>) and use that information to try an extrapolate a forecast for my wealth-building. Believe it or not,
                  budgeting is something I really enjoy (seeing money leave my account, not so much). Money in general is something that really interests me, macroeconomic trends are something that I spend a lot of time reading about and trying to understand as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Finally, there is my dog Ruby. I love spending time with her. Walking her, training her, and just hanging out with her. She is one of the biggest highlights in my life.
                </p>

                <h2 class="uk-heading-divider">In A Nutshell</h2>

                <p>
                  I suppose that pretty much describes me in a nutshell. If you didn't read that wall of text, I don't blame you. The <i>tl;dr</i> is this:
                </p>

                <p>
                  I'm more or less a shut-in who spends a lot of time developing my IT skills. If you need someone with a wide variety of IT knowledge, I am probably your guy. I can fix your printer, or I can build you a fleet of production-ready Kubernetes clusters. 
                </p>
